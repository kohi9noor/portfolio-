In this internship at Curious Connect, I worked on real-time communication technologies and developed scalable video conferencing solutions. My main focus was building a product that could handle multiple conferences at the same time, with many participants.

I learned a lot about WebRTC and researched ways to scale it using SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) and MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) methods. I also worked with Mediasoup, a Node.js library for SFU, to make our video conferencing system more efficient and able to support more users.
