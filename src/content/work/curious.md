At **Curious Connect**, I worked on improving the **performance** of a **resume parser** by integrating **Redis** to speed up **data caching** and **retrieval**. This change **reduced processing time by 60%**, making the system much **faster** and more **efficient**. I also added advanced features using the **Gemini API**, which improved the **accuracy** of extracting and categorizing candidate profiles to **98%**.

I built a **scalable system** to handle **large volumes** of **resume data**, ensuring **real-time parsing** worked smoothly even during **peak traffic**. On top of that, I explored and implemented technologies like **WebRTC** and **Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU)** to create a **media streaming solution** that **reduced latency by 30%**.
